# Session IV

## Type System
### value
* structs & enum
* is on the stack
* fixed memory size (i.e. on the stack)
* pass by copy

### reference
* classes & unsafe pointers
* is on the heap
* is of variable memory size (i.e. on the heap)
* pass by reference
* prefixed `&` will turn value type to reference type
  * var foo = 'asdf'; someRefFunction(&foo)

### abstract
* protocols
* the answer to multiple inheritance
* allows a type to behave as the subtype of multiple types


## Classes and Objects
* instantiate class like so: `var shape = Shape()`
* `init` function does not have `func` keyword.
* Inheritance affects init structure
  * must instantiate local variables before `super.init`
  * then `super.init`
  * then overwrite attrs in super class

```swift
init(sideLength: Double, name: String) {
    self.sideLength = sideLength // <-- local
    super.init(name: name) // super
    numberOfSides = 4 // over-writing super instance values
}
```

* can have computed values -- gets and sets
  * read-only is just a computed value with no `set`

* Listener pattern
  * `willSet` get notified before it changes
  * `didSet` get notified after it changed


### initializers
* `convenience` initializer -- sets defaults and call designated initializer
* opposite of convenience is `designated`
* failable: can return an optional. Nil or value. Uses `?`


### Extenstions
* add functionality to exisiting class
* cannot add uncomputed properties.


## Classes vs Structs
* structs are value types
* cannot be subclassed
* cannot be curried
* structs need the mutating keyword to change values (because the stack!)

## Enums
* have case statements at the top
  * enumerate every value it can take
* can set `rawValue`

## Protocol
* functions have no implementation, just interface that class conforms to
* abstract interface not implementation
* Classes can conform to multiple protocols


## Generic
* "template for specific type"
* where the type is a variable to be specified in invocation
