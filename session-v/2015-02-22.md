### UIView and CALayer
- NS* objects come from Foundation
- there was a re-architecting when smart phones became a thing
- UIView wraps a least one of the drawing layers (CALayer)
- CALayer handles animations
- Animation rules, especially on ipad
- CALayer is all about drawing
- UIView marries the drawing of the CALayer with gestures


### Types of CALayer
Multiple types of layers that represent different drawing actions and functionality


### Drawing
>drawRect(rect:) is the critical drawing method of a UIView. It is called only when there is a valid CGGraphicsContext available and with the rect which needs redrawing.

You cannot force the drawRect, i.e. a redraw. You can "suggest" the device redraw and it will get to it, i.e. `setNeedsDisplay`. See also `setNeedsLayout` for when bounds and frames get updated and re-draw is needed


- `NSAttributedString` takes string and attributes (like style, color, etc).

- `CGRectMake` convenience function to create the CGRect struct with its component structs of origin and size


### UIImage
- wraps CIImage; analgous to UIView and CALayer


CIImage represents an image, but is not an image.
- abstraction of image content
