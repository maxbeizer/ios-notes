# Session V

### Log
look for println-magic
* repo will have function that will share more helpful in log messages

## Life cycle
### didFinishLaunching
* happens on initial run
* do not block this (it is time limited)
* do initial app set up
* add analytics

### applictationDidBecomeActive
* app is shown -- launch or returns from background
* custom notification perhaps

### applicationWillResignActive
* happens when something is going to break into your app (i.e. phone call battery warning) amongst others

### applicationDidEnterBackground

### applicationWillEnterForeground

### didReceiveMemoryWarning

### applicationWillTerminate
* swipe up in after double click home
* OS is going to kill it
* just use willEnterBackground


### target >> capabilites >> background modes
* need to run the app in the background -- like sound apps
* has background fetch to get content while in background
  * have to set minimum background fetch interval


### AppDelegate Role
* global
* for system-wide
* use for lifecycle


### NSNotificationCenter
* register and post notification available globally to your app
* essentially your app's global pub/sub
* use `defaultCener()`
* then `addObservierForName`
* for queue, generally use `NSOperationQueue.mainQueue()`
* also there is `postNotification` to pub from NSNotificationCenter


## Register URL Scheme

target >> info >> URL Types
* you can prompt the open the app dialog in mobile safari
* NSURL
* NSURLComponents -> pass url and loop through params in URL
* Don't send secure stuff in params (other apps could register that URL and potentially get what you send)
* `canOpenURL` is available on the application singleton. You could register the "open in chrome" or whatever check if it can open the thing here.
* `openURL` will perform the open

## Background Task
* `UIApplication.sharedApplication().beginBackgroundTaskWithExpirationHandler` say that you need application will need background time. Pass expiration handler to gracefully handle when time expires
* `UIApplication.sharedApplication().endBackgroundTask(taskId)` handles you released memory in background task

## UILocalNotification
* can be scheduled by time/interval corelocation
* have to register for notifications

## applicationSignificantTimeChange
* a system event for when your user changes time zone or something related to time

## stateRestoration
* can restore state even if you app gets killed when backgrounded


## UIViewController
* preferredStatusBarStyle
* preferredStatusBarHidden
* `UIStatusBarStyle`
* target >> info >> Status bar is initially hidden
* `viewDidLoad` -> setup the view controller
  * mostly, won't get called again
* `viewWillDisappear` and `viewDidDisappear`
* `viewWillAppear` and `viewDidAppear`

* content inset will allow buffer space on scoll view.
* content offset is where it scrolls view.
* there is also content size

* has one view property. Can update that view property in view controller. It is essential the root view and has subviews.


## MISC
* `cmd option shift left-arrow` folds all functions
* `cmd option shift right-arrow` un-folds all functions
