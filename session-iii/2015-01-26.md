### obj-c

```obj-c
- (void)setCompletionBlockWithSuccess:(void (^)(AFHTTPRequestOperation *operation, id responseObject))success
failure:(void (^)(AFHTTPRequestOperation *operation, NSError *error))failure;
```
* `-` indicates instance method, `+` indicates class method
* `void` means 'returns nothing'
* `(^)` is closure syntax, called "block"

* `@interface AFHTTPRequestOperation : AFURLConnectionOperation` << indicates inheritance

* NSObject = base object
* protocols implement multiple inheritance, where classes are single inheritance
* full reflection API
* All objects are allocated on the heap-- i.e. no stack allocation
* objects are instantiated via two steps: alloc and init.
* Uses the LLVM, no real vm to speak of.
* "Does not have mutability in the language, it comes from the classes"
* everything is a reference type

### Swift
* Chris Lattner
* Not everything in Swift can "get over the fence" to ObjC
* Functions are first class
* no single base class
* no reflection (well, minimal reflection)
* functions are first class
* heap and stack allocation


### Playground
* make sure to add `public` to functions you want to be available from other things.

### Moar swift

```swift
let myConstant = 42
_stdlib_demangleName(_stdlib_getTypeName(myConstant)) // gets the type!!
```

* `String?` = Optional type string, i.e. String or nil

* the `as` keyword allows you set types as well:
```swift
var mutableArrayExplicit3 = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] as [Int]
```

* dictionaries are value types, not references types. Reference to a copy. Mutability => reference type, immutability => value types

  * NS stuff is reference (objc)
  * swift stuff is value

* Struct: value type
* Class: reference type

* there is a sequence type (`SequenceType`) which gives you a `generate()` function

* `?` optional type
* `!` explicitly unwrapped (i.e. not allowing nil) in usage
* `!` implicitly unwraped in declaration

"Optional is just a type that is parameterized"

* `??` replaces the `if let` essentially ternary with default value
